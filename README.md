# Rock-Paper-Scissor

I've implemented the most familiar game rock-paper-scissor from scratch.

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45707143/120292647-1d020080-c2e2-11eb-86c0-6d4c5d7f1ba7.gif)

This game is for 2 players.
Player 1: Computer (Default),
Player 2: You.

You're allowed to choose your move to play with the computer and then see who wins.
